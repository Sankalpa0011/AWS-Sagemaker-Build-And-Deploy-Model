# SageMaker Model Building and Deployment
---

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to build, train, and deploy a machine learning model using Amazon SageMaker. The notebook integrates multiple AWS services, such as Lambda, API Gateway, IAM, and S3, to create a complete end-to-end machine learning solution.

## Overview

The project involves the following key steps:
- **Data Preparation**: Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
- **Move Data Into S3 Bucket**: Uploading the prepared data to an Amazon S3 bucket for use in SageMaker.
- **Create Model**: Defining the machine learning model and its hyperparameters.
- **Train Model**: Training the model on SageMaker using the data in the S3 bucket.
- **Deploy Model**: Deploying the trained model as an endpoint for real-time inference using API Gateway and Lambda.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Amazon SageMaker SDK
- Boto3
- Jupyter Notebook
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions

## AWS Services Used

The project leverages the following AWS services:

- **Lambda**: To create serverless functions that interact with the deployed model.
- **API Gateway**: To create RESTful APIs that expose the model for external use.
- **IAM**: To manage permissions for accessing S3 buckets, Lambda functions, and SageMaker endpoints.
- **Amazon SageMaker**: To build, train, and deploy machine learning models.
- **S3**: To store datasets, training results, and model artifacts.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your_repository
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Sagemaker Build And Deploy Model.ipynb"
   ```

## Notebook Structure

The notebook is divided into several sections:

1. **Data Preparation**: Details the steps to clean and prepare the dataset for training.
2. **Move Data Into S3 Bucket**: Shows how to upload data to Amazon S3 for use with SageMaker.
3. **Create Model**: Covers the steps to define a machine learning model and set its hyperparameters.
4. **Train Model**: Demonstrates how to train the model using SageMaker.
5. **Deploy Model**: Provides steps to deploy the trained model to an endpoint using Lambda and API Gateway for real-time inference.

## Usage

To run the notebook:

1. Follow the steps in each cell sequentially, ensuring that the necessary AWS permissions and configurations are set up.
2. Modify the parameters and configurations as needed to suit your dataset and model requirements.
3. Monitor the model training and deployment processes through the AWS Management Console or using the SageMaker SDK functions provided in the notebook.
